# Algorithmic_Programming
This is where I will put solutions I write to USA Computing Olympiad and other algorithmic problems.

I will only put solutions here if I think they are interesting and have a nice solution. 
But, please do not steal this code! 
USACO is meant to be a fun coding experience that challenges all of us at the level we are at.

USACO Bronze Folder: Solutions from Chapter 1-2 USACO Training Getaway and Bronze Level Solutions

USACO Silver Folder: Mostly USACO Silver Problem Solutions, but some USACO Gold Solutions

Miscellaneous Folder: Mathematically-based Algorithms in graph theory and linear algebra

This is mostly a logbook for me to remember which solutions I liked a lot,
and which solutions I will rewrite.
