# Algorithmic_Programming
This is where I will put solutions I write to USA Computing Olympiad and other algorithmic problems.

I will only put solutions here if I think they are interesting and have a nice solution. 

Please do not steal these answers! 
USACO is meant to be a fun coding experience.

This is mostly a logbook for me to remember which solutions I liked a lot,
and which solutions I will rewrite.
